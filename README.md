# Dear Designer - The "Screw You Guys" Portfolio

Alright? 

Look, I don't know why you're here. Presumably, you want a website. Or you're just nosy. Either way, here it is. The pinnacle of human achievement: a portfolio that actively mocks the very industry it's trying to get hired in. Brilliant strategy, that. 

## What is this rubbish?

It's a single-page scrolling website. It's got "South Park" style animations, a bit of satire about the soul-crushing reality of creative work, and some code I probably stole from Stack Overflow. 

It features:
*   **Infinite Revision Swing**: Watch a CEO flap his head while demanding changes. It's like a documentary.
*   **Budget Seesaw**: A visual representation of your dreams dying as the budget shrinks.
*   **Deployment Slide**: The terrified scream of a developer pushing to production on a Friday.

## How to run it

Right, it's just HTML, isn't it? You don't need a degree in rocket surgery.

1.  **Download it.** Clone the repo. Or don't. I get paid either way. (I don't).
2.  **Open `index.html` in a browser.** Chrome, Firefox, Edge if you're a masochist.
3.  **Scroll.** That's it. Just scroll down. 

### For the Nerds (Local Development)

If you absolutely must use a terminal because it makes you feel like you're in *The Matrix*:

```bash
# Install a simple server because opening files directly is for peasants
npm install -g serve

# Run it
serve .
```

Then go to `localhost:3000` or whatever magic number it spits out.

## Deployment

You want to put this on the internet? Brave. 

It's ready for Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or a floppy disk if you can find one. 
*   **Vercel/Netlify:** Just drag the folder into their dashboard. Done.
*   **GitHub Pages:** Enable it in settings. Boom. 

## Contributing

Don't. I've got enough problems. 

But if you spot a bug, just pretend it's a feature. That's what I do. "It's not broken, it's *avante-garde*."

## License

Do whatever you want with it. Copy it, sell it, print it out and eat it. I don't care. Just don't blame me when your client asks why the logo isn't bigger.

Cheers.
